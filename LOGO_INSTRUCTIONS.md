# PSA Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Logo

To complete the logo integration, please follow these steps:

1. **Save your logo image** as `psa-logo.png` in the root directory of this project
2. **Recommended size**: 350x350 pixels or larger (the website will scale it appropriately)
3. **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred

## Current Setup

The website is now configured to display your beautiful PSA logo instead of the animated flag. The logo features:

- **Floating animation** that gently moves up and down
- **Hover effects** that scale and glow when you mouse over it
- **Click interaction** that triggers a special animation and shows a PSA message
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Fallback Option

If you don't have the logo image ready yet, you can temporarily use a placeholder by:

1. Creating a simple colored circle with the text "PSA" 
2. Or using any temporary image named `psa-logo.png`

## Logo Features

- **Circular design** that matches your logo's shape
- **Pakistan green shadow** that complements the theme
- **Smooth animations** that enhance the user experience
- **Interactive elements** that engage visitors

The logo will be prominently displayed on the hero section of your website, replacing the previous animated flag while maintaining the beautiful green and white theme of your PSA website.
